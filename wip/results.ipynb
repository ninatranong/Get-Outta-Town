It was among the first countries in the world to legalize same-sex marriage and adoption by same-sex couples. Sweden's government and society have consistently supported and promoted the rights of LGBTQ+ individuals, resulting in a high level of social acceptance and legal protection for this community compared to many other nations.\", 'language': 'Swedish is the official language of Sweden, spoken by the majority of the population. It belongs to the North Germanic branch of the Indo-European language family and is closely related to Norwegian and Danish, forming a dialect continuum known as the Scandinavian languages.', 'cannabis': 'Sweden has a strict stance on cannabis, classifying it as an illegal narcotic. Possession, cultivation, and distribution are punishable by fines or imprisonment. Despite this, there is a growing movement in Sweden advocating for the legalization of cannabis for both medical and recreational purposes.'}\n"
